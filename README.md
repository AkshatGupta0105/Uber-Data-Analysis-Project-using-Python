# Uber-Data-Analysis-Project-using-Python
Analyzed Uber ride data using Python to uncover trends in trip purpose, time of day, and distance. Found most rides were business-related, with peaks in the evening and short travel distances. Used pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize patterns and gain insights.
